    <h1>Hungry? Why Wait?</h1>
    <p>For real though.  Theres probably a 7-11 or something pretty close to you right now.  Grab an Uber and shoot over to the minimart and grab yourself a king sized snickers.  It's got peanuts and nougut so technically it can be dinner.</p>

<div class="well well-sm">Have you ever wondered what the most perfect food in the world is?  Well, my cousin Freddie swears it's a Snickers bar.</div>

<div class="well well-lg">AND FREDDIE WOULDN'T LIE!</div>

<div class="well">He's like the smartest person I know.  One time my car broke down and he got it running using only a barbeque brush and a monkey wrench.  He once held his breath under water for 8 minutes.  I wasn't there but two of his friends were and they swore he did it.  Anyways.  The important takeaway is that Snickers bars are pretty much the best thing you could eat.  Truth.</div>
